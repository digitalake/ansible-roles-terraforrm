# Ansible-roles-terraforrm
Code to deploy several vms + Ansible to configure

### Hi there! ###
In this repo u can find some Terraform code to use locally and Ansible role-structured playbook.

### How it works ? ###

Terraform:
  - Terraform with _dmacvicar/libvirt_ provider_
  > Note! u need to have libvirt (Qemu KVM VirtManager)
  - Ubuntu Iso image downloaded locally
  - Minio: S3-based storage for terraform backend
  
Terraform is being used to deploy several vms via _for_each_ constructure.

Terraform generates Ansible _hosts.ini_ file for being used in future playbooks executions.

Ansible:
  - Uses dir hierarchy with rules + playbook
  ```
file-creator.yml(for creating iaac file in /etc dir)
get-distro-info.yml(for getting info about hosts Ansible is working with)
inventory/
└── hosts.ini(generated by Terraform)
roles/
├── file-cerator/
│   └── tasks/
|         └── main.yml
└── informer/
      └── tasks/
            └── main.yml
 ```
  - Uses reusable rules
  
As i said preiously, Terraform generates inventory for ansible.

For this purpose the _ansible-hosts.tpl_ file was created.

### How to use ###
Files need to be created additinaly:
  - _cloud_init.cfg_
  - _terraform.tfvars_ (with your own variables values)
  - right template(u can see an example in this repo) for performing _hosts.ini_ generation
  > Note! U can use input variables list from _variables.terraform_ file
  - recommend u to change ansible config file for disabling host_key_checking
  
>About TF backend: if u feel unconfident using TF backend u can skip backend block and use terraform with tfstate locally

### How to use ###

```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
```
cd ansible
```
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini -u <remote user>  really-main.yml
```
